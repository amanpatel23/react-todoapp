# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Hosted Link:
https://react-todoapp-ap.netlify.app/

### react-todoapp
It fetches the todos from the JSONPlaceholder api and shows that on the screen. Users can perfrom the CRUD operation using the REST API (although all the API requests are fake and they don't really change anything on the server but the changes will get reflected on the screen).

### Features:
1. Users can add a new todo item by calling a POST request on the api. Although the request is the fake request and it doesn't add a new item to the server. But the new todo item gets reflected on the screen using states.
2. Users can update an existing todo item. (api call doesn't update the item on the server but the changes gets reflected on the screen)
3. Users can delete an existing todo item. (api call doesn't delete the item from the server but the item gets removed locally)
4. Users can toggle the task completion status.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
